            With the release of five studio albums and 2 EPs, Mitski has secured her position as one of the most influential artists over the last decade. Her most recent albums, “Puberty 2” and “Be the Cowboy” have charted Top 20 and Top 5 in the United States respectively. Her sixth album, “Laurel Hell,” is set to be released in February of 2022.

            <p>

            Mitski started off self-releasing her music before signing with the independent label “Dead Oceans.” Her first two albums, “Lush” and “Retired from Sad, New Career in Business” were both released as student projects, marking the start of her career in the music industry. Her third album, “Bury Me at Makeout Creek” relied heavily upon her exhausted state as it heavily influenced its creation and was released after she graduated college and attempted to balance the different paths her life was taking.
