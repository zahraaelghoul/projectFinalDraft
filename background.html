        Being Japanese-American, Mitski’s music reflects a lot of themes related to identity and belonging that many people of color and those who belong to marginalized communities often resonate with. Mitski’s cross-cultural identity is also something that stays constant within her music.

        Her music embodies feelings of isolation, love, longing, racial identity, and so much more throughout the lyrics of her songs as they encompass her own personal feelings. Her songs “Strawberry Blonde” and “Your Best American Girl,” for example, cover her identity as an Asian American woman and are heavily laced with the feeling of lacking desirability and yearning for viability in her relationships. The sentiments in her music are widely applicable and can resonate with many, but it’s easy to recognize that a lot of her music will likely appeal most to others with similar experiences as her.
