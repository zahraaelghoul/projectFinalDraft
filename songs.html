                <p>In this song, Mitski writes about the woes of being young and growing older, and the intense relationships that accompany you as you go on that journey. She specifically describes a particularly intense relationship with another and with herself, and includes a line in Japanese, which she does not often do in her music.</p>

                <p>"Two Slow Dancers" is from the point view of two long lost lovers, spending their final night dancing together. They are both aware of how limited and temporary their time together is, so they are holding onto the last moments of their love, whilst reminicing their lost past. This song is slow and sad- one of her slowest. </p>

                <p>Mitski adresses her love for someone that is unreturned in "Pink in the Night." Here, she says that although they may never feel the same, she has an overabundance of love for them, even if the love is unrequited. The lyrics "I could stare at your back all day" imply that Mitski is willing to reserve this person's spot in her life, even if they turn their back to her or want nothing to do with her. </p>

                <p>Betting on losing dogs is a metaphor for Mitski being in a relationship with someone knowing that it will not last forever, and the end will not be kind to or easy on her. The "losing dogs" in question is her relationship with her partner. She is investing her time and energy into something that will inevitably fail and hurt her. </p>

                <p>"Heat Lightning" is one of Mitski's most easy-going songs, with lyrics about reconcilliation with oneself and others. She repeats "I surrender" throughout the song, giving up on the perfect image and high standard she had set for herself in the past. This song is broad and much more realistic than her other songs, which tend to be more painful. </p>

                <p class = "link">From: https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1882139175_10.jpg</p>
                <p>Here, it is obvious that Mitski is grieving a loss. Her opening lines question what she will do and how she will deal with the loss of this person. She is unable to figure out who she is without them, and without them being the center of her life.</p>

                <p>This song is about the end of pain and new beginnings. Mitski describes herself as "worn" and a "forest fire" implying that she is tired and burned out from the relationship, ready to move on and start anew. This is relateable to a wide audience as it can be applied to relationships, school, friendships, and many other daily applications of life. </p>

                <p>"Your Best American Girl" is from the perspective of a woman of color, wishing to be the subject of her white crush's desires. Over the course of the song, she begins wishing he would love and accept her, but eventually learns to love and accept her own self by the end of the song. This is one of Mitski's most popular songs, as many people of color can relate to the struggle with wishing they were accepted more socially as well as romantically. </p>

                <p>In this song, Mitski cries to her mom, asking if she can stay with her, knowing how hard it can be for art students to survive financially out in the real world. This song is generally seen as Mitski's saddest song, although it is the shortest. It is filled with intense emotions and heart-wrenching lyrics. </p>
